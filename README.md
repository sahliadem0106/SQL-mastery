# SQL-mastery
I've studied SQL in high school and I really enjoyed it; the taste of seeing your select query working was unique.  After one year of computer engineering, I decided to put my SQL coding skills on the test. I was pretty good; logic is there, but I need to refresh my memory and write some queries.  Now after learning more about cloud data, I decided to make a personal plan to b sql be better in sql, a plan that matches my goals; it's easy to learn but hard to master.
 solving a problem pushes you forward; it's like discovering a new cases, new possibilities, clearer vision 
I am going to share my SQL mastery journey here in this repository documenting every step, every line of code
